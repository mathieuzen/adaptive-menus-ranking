    description: 'Bolding menus are another form where predicted items are boldfaced. A split menu, a bolding menu, an adaptable menu, and a traditional menu were compared for a normal screen. This study showed that the adaptable menu outperformed the other menus in terms of overall performance and subjective satisfaction. Different forms of emphasizing items in the predicted window may be investigated, such as by highlighting, by underlying, by bolding, by italicizing, etc. The design space that will be later defined will enable us to investigate these options more extensively.' },

    description: 'Bubbling menus represent a design for cascading drop-down menus aimed at accelerating the selection of the frequently used items by directly jumping to them one by one. To this end, two techniques are combined: the bubble cursor, whose size dynamically changes as the cursor moves and selects the target within the closest distance, especially for frequently-based items; and directional mouse-gesture techniques, which accelerate reaching predicted items.' },
  { name: 'Cloud Menu', description: 'Cloud Menus are a split adaptive menu for small screens where the predicted menu items are arranged in a circular tag cloud with a location consistent with their corresponding position in the static menu and a font size depending on their prediction level. An empirical study suggests that cloud menus reduce item selection time and error rate when prediction is correct without penalizing it when prediction is incorrect, compared to two baselines: a non-adaptive static menu and an adaptive linear menu.' },
  { name: 'Ephemeral Menu',

  { name: 'Evanescent Menu',

  { name: 'Fish-eye Menu',
    description: 'Fish-eye menus display items with a font size that increases or decreases depending on the distance with respect to cursor position: the closer, the larger, the further, the smaller. Per se, fish-eye menus are not adaptive since their layout does not change depending on predicted items. They are able to increase the selection area of any item, which might be useful for predicted items.' },

  { name: 'Hyperbolic Menu',
    description: 'Hyperbolic menus is a Focus + Context technique for displaying and manipulating large hierarchies. It displays several hierarchy levels at once according to a hyperbolic tree which minimizes screen usage. All menu items are displayed on this hyperbolic tree. Since parts of the hyperbolic view are expanding and collapsing depending on the position of the cursor, menu items are never displayed at the same place, thus inducing spatial instability, which is difficult to use for novice users and without fine visio-motor coordination.' },
  { name: 'In-context Appearing Menu',
    description: 'In-Context Disappearing (ICD) approach has been applied to menus for small screens: at opening the static menu, the end user finds a superposition of the full list of items with the prediction window prompting predicted items. This latter contains three predicted items and disappears gradually. The presentation of predicted items in the prediction window remains homogeneous, thus preserving spatial stability.' },

    description: 'Description of Italiczing Menu' },
  { name: 'Morphing Menu',
    description: 'Morphing menus change the font size of each menu item depending on its prediction: the font size is increased, respectively decreased, if the prediction is high, respectively low. While morphing menus preserve spatial stability, they facilitate selecting accurately-predicted items, but complexify selecting items with low or inaccurate prediction. Morphing menus made manipulation easier with enlarged activation areas in cascading menus. The objective was to eliminate the explicit delay for activation found in several implementations.' },
  { name: 'Out-context Disappearing Menu',
    description: 'Out-of-Context Disappearing (OCD) approach is the inverse of ICD: at opening, the prediction window is immediately displayed with the predicted items, like in a split menu; after 500 msec, the complete menu is gradually displayed from the back, thus replacing the prediction window.' },

    description: 'Probability-based menus sort items by decreasing probability of selection: most popular items are positioned near the beginning of the menu. During the initial stages of practice, probability- based menus produce faster mean selection times than the static menu, the random menu (where items are randomly arranged), and the alphabetic menu (where items are sorted by increasing alphabetical order). After some practice, the static menu becomes better than the probability-based menu. End users remember easily the item position in the menu, indicating that spatial stability is an important factor in increasing the efficiency of menu selection.' },

Smart menus track how often an end user invokes each item, in order to predict frequently-used and recently used menu items. Smart menus provide beginners with a starting guided path toward learning a new UI. Menus become adaptive when they reflect the users’ work habits. In short, a MFU scheme automatically hides unused items.' },
  { name: 'Split Menu with Arrowbar',
    description: 'Split menus assemble a prediction window (here, a topmost area promoting a small list of predicted items, typically 2-3) and a static menu. Menu items are initially predicted according MFU scheme and later on expanded to other schemes such as MRU, DOI, or any combination of them. Any menu item appears in either the static part or in the predicted window, which may confuse users who constantly oscillate between the two areas to find their item. Split menus with replication restore spatial stability: the prediction window remains as stated before but the second part remains unaltered, thus enabling end users to always refer to the static menu as they know it.' },

This menu maintains spatial stability, thus helping the end user to maintain a mental model of the menu. Transposing temporal menu to smartphone is not straightforward because all items cannot be displayed on a single screen.
