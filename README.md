#Getting started
Assuming you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine,
cd into the project root folder and start a simple http server
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
```
if you are using windows you may have to use the http.server instead of SimpleHTTPServer
```
python -m http.server 8888
```
then browse to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) (may need a refresh first to show content)
